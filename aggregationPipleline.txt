//1.for all the filter queries we use to do find method
//2.find method pure document mai use hota hai 
//3. iska matalb hai ki each and every document apne apne mai seperate document hai un documents mai jo bhi chize(keys:value pair)  particular condition ko match kar rahi hai un sabhi documents ko filter karke lane ka kaam find method karti hai 

Chapter 2: aggregation pipeline 
group karenge documents ka fir unme kuch find karne wale hai 
pipeline ek ke baad dusra 


mongodb is having objectid with itself which makes all the document unique. It has no such problem of primary key, secondary key, candidate key.

mongodb is scalable  
It stores data either of the two methods One is vertical scalable method and other one is horizontal scalable method. 

System design mein ek part hoti hai scaling 

sharding : horizontal vertical 
horizontal we divide the physical memory into multiple sub memories 
vertical we try to increase the physical memory 


aggregation pipleline ke mostly used operators hai: 

$match == find  
condition ko match karwane ke liye use hogi 

$group : jab hume documents ki grouping karni hogi

$projection : jab humne limited keys dikhani ho 

$unwind : jab hume array ko todna ho 

system design:
1. monolithic architecture
2. distributive architecture

database:  monolithic or distributive
monolithic = find, vertical scaling
distributive = aggregation pipleline, horizontal scaling
